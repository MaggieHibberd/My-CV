An accomplished ex(!)-project manager with a background in digital services with the soft and hard skills to flourish in testing roles. My experience collaborating at pace in multidisciplinary teams to deliver large scale projects together with a foundation in software development practices gives me the confidence to add value to technical teams and products. 

My strong communication skills, an unstoppable drive to seek out errors and flexible approach to problem solving has sparked my motivation to create outstanding software in a engineer role.
